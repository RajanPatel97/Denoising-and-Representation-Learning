# Denoising-and-Representation-Learning
An exploration into the effectiveness of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for de-noising and representation learning is conducted for matching experiments presented in this report. The objective is to generate powerful learned descriptors from noisy image patches, capable of successfully performing tasks based on strictly defined evaluation protocols in the HPatches Benchmark such as matching, retrieval and verification. Such protocols enable realistic and reliable comparisons for different application scenarios, and facilitate the search of an optimal approach that maximizes performance, whilst taking into consideration computational complexity and generalizability.
